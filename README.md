# ComfyUI native implementation of IC-Light

Huge thanks to lllyasviel for yet more amazing models!
Original repository: https://github.com/lllyasviel/IC-Light

# Installation

Recommended way is to use the manager. There should be no extra requirements needed.
Manual way is to clone this repo to the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` -folder.

The models are also available through the Manager, search for "IC-light". By default they go to `ComfyUI/models/unet/IC-Light`

Alternatively download them from here and place anywhere in the `ComfyUI/models/unet` -folder:

Some of the example workflows require the very latest features in KJNodes:
